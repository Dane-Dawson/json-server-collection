      "description": "Before Perseus was born, Acrisius, the king of Argos, was told by an oracle that his grandson would kill him. His daughter Danae was therefore trapped beneath the earth so that she could not have intercourse. Zeus however, turned into golden rain, trickled inside the earth, and eventually reached Danae, who then became pregnant with Perseus. Shocked, Acrisius sent Danae and Perseus to his brother, Polydectus, who was the king of the island. Eventually, Polydectus wanted Danae to be his wife, but knowing that Perseus would not allow it, he sent Perseus into a mission to take Medusa's head. Medusa was a gorgon in which whenever anyone looked at her face, they would turn to stone. With the help of Hermes and Athena, Perseus killed Medusa and brought her head back.",
