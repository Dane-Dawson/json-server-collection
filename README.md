# json-server-collection

Work in progress.

Built to be a collection of potentially fun and useful small db.json files for projects or practice. 

Each folder holds it's own db.json (some with a `routes.json`), and those with associations or other "fanciness" have an `INFO.md` file to help describe how to use it.

Some have internal links (or images) from their source that don't work, and contain links to their api that can be used for sequential fetching.
